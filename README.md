This package provides an easy way to quickly set up [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/) with Laravel 5.5/+. It has no requirements and dependencies besides Laravel, so you can start building your admin panel immediately. The package just provides a Blade template that you can extend and advanced menu configuration possibilities. A replacement for the `make:auth` Artisan command that uses AdminLTE styled views instead of the default Laravel ones is also included.
